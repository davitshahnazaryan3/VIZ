# Visualization AID

Aid to postprocess analysis results, visualize and export them

**Required packages**

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, xlrd, re

Requires inkscape: for vectorized high quality image exports

### Modules

1. EqEngineering - seismic engineering related postprocessing

    1. SPO - visualization for SPO analysis
    
    2. IDA - visualization for IDA
    
    3. Loss - visualization for los assessment

    4. SLF - visualization for storey loss functions

    5. Hazard - visualization for PSHA / Hazard

### Postprocessor

1. [ ] IDA results
